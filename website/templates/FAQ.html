    <h4>Why is Bulking "bad"?</h4>
     <li>A bulk is not going to give you more "gains" and is not needed to get "gains". Eating at an excessive bulk will just put on excessive fat. </li>
     <li>Calories are not the driver of muscle growth, what causes growth is the stimulus that your brain responds to when lifting weights.</li>
     <li>Now does this mean to avoid ever going above your maintenance calories? No, if you want to gain weight because you are skinny or underweight, it should be done by at max eating +300 calories from your maintenance. </li>
     <li>If you are at a healthy bodyweight and bodyfat% eating at maintenance is all that is needed, gaining muscle is a slow process.</li>
     <br>
     <h4>What stimulates growth or grows muscle then?</h4>
      <li>First i'm going to tell you what doesn't, muscle is NOT built through micro trauma and tears.</li>
      <li>The main driver of hypertrophy(muscle growth) is Mechanical Tension. </li>
      <li>Mechanical tension is a pulling force experienced by muscle fibers when they try to shorten but are resisted. 
        This force increases as the speed of contraction slows down, which happens as you approach failure during a set.</li>
    <li>The force a muscle can produce depends on its contraction speed.
        As you get closer to failure, your contraction speed slows involuntarily, even if you're trying to move the weight quickly.
        This is when maximum mechanical tension occurs, as more cross-bridging happens between the proteins actin and myosin, which are responsible for muscle force production.</li>
     <li>Heavier Loads ≠ More Tension. Light loads taken to failure create similar mechanical tension (and hypertrophy) as heavy loads.</li>
        <li>Tension Isn’t Accumulated.
            Mechanical tension is experienced by active fibers during a set, not accumulated over volume.</li>
    <br>
    <h4>Why low reps?</h4>
    <li>Training should be EFFECIENT.</li>
    <li>Although lifting heavier loads doesn't increase mechanical tension, it is less fatigue inducing to lift heavier loads to reach near failure faster. Doing 20 reps or 12 reps to reach failure is ineffecient</li>
    <li>Studies have shown that the last 5 repetitions in a set to failure produce the most growth stimulus. Mentioned before, Mechanical Tension is highest in these last 5 repetitions. Credit to Chris Beardsley on his Effective Reps model</li>

    <h4>Why not failure or drop sets or intesifiers or assisted reps or partials?</h4>
    <li>Leaving a rep or two in the tank will give fairly SIMILAR results to going to failure with less fatigue. Less fatigue is the key point here, we want to workout and recover so we can progressively overload</li>
    <li>Drop sets, intesifiers, assisted reps, partials are all useless. They all cause more fatigue than benefit.</li>
    <li>Your brain sends signals to your body to recruit more motor units when mechanical tension is highest.</li>
    <li>If you were to do a dropset/intesifier after a regular set there wouldn't be much benefit due to sufficient mechanical tension already being achieved and the subsequent sets would just be worse.</li>
    <li>Assisted reps follow the same thinking, when you are being assisted, how is that increasing mechanical tension? It just lessens it and causes fatigue.</li>
    <li>In conclusion, they just cause fatigue and not much growth stimulus.</li>
